          |More than 1.7 billion people use various methods of social media today.  It has grown from a way to keep in
          |touch with family or meet new people, to a powerful tool for businesses to harness massive amounts of data.  
          |Those ies as well as individuals, spend more time navigating the hundreds of social media outlets than 
          |any other internet activity.  Wouldnâ€™t it be nice to have a single location where all the information from those 
          |sites could be brought together?

          |BUNDL is a management website designed to integrate the information and features of various social media 
          |outlets. Its primary goal is to give people an efficient and user-friendly way to post information as well as 
          |monitor replies and messages in a single cohesive application.  
          |The main features of BUNDL will include: Posting to multiple social media outlets at the same time, pulling 
          |replies and comments from various media that apply to the same message (even from different sources) into a 
          |single easy to navigate interface, manage formatting differences between different media without user 
          |interaction, and supply a host of data analysis tools that would allow companies to discover deep correlations 
          |between their customers and products to increase marketing potential.
          |BUNDL would alleviate the need for the entire world to spend time juggling a multitude of different websites,
          |and instead let them focus on what is really important: their message.
