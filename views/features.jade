            |More than 1.7 billion people use various methods of social media today.  It has grown from a way to keep in
            |touch with family or meet new people, to a powerful tool for businesses to harness massive amounts of data.  
            |Those ies as well as individuals, spend more time navigating the hundreds of social media outlets than 
            |any other internet activity.  Wouldnâ€™t it be nice to have a single location where all the information from those 
            |sites could be brought together?
            p
            |BUNDL is a management website designed to integrate the information and features of various social media 
            |outlets. Its primary goal is to give people an efficient and user-friendly way to post information as well as 
            |monitor replies and messages in a single cohesive application.  
            |The main features of BUNDL will include: Posting to multiple social media outlets at the same time, pulling 
            |replies and comments from various media that apply to the same message (even from different sources) into a 
            |single easy to navigate interface, manage formatting differences between different media without user 
            |interaction, and supply a host of data analysis tools that would allow companies to discover deep correlations 
            |between their customers and products to increase marketing potential.
            |BUNDL would alleviate the need for the entire world to spend time juggling a multitude of different websites,
            |and instead let them focus on what is really important: their message.
