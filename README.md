# Bundl

More than 1.7 billion people use various methods of social media today.  It has grown from a way to keep in touch with family or meet new people, to a powerful tool for businesses to harness massive amounts of data. Those companies as well as individuals, spend more time navigating the hundreds of social media outlets than any other internet activity.  Wouldn’t it be nice to have a single location where all the information from those sites could be brought together?

BUNDL is a management website designed to integrate the information and features of various social media outlets. Its primary goal is to give people an efficient and user-friendly way to post information as well as monitor replies and messages in a single cohesive application.  

The main features of BUNDL will include: Posting to multiple social media outlets at the same time, pulling replies and comments from various media that apply to the same message (even from different sources) into a single easy to navigate interface, manage formatting differences between different media without user interaction, and supply a host of data analysis tools that would allow companies to discover deep correlations between their customers and products to increase marketing potential.

BUNDL would alleviate the need for the entire world to spend time juggling a multitude of different websites, and instead let them focus on what is really important: their message.
